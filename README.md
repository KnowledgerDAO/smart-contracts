This is the project designed to be the smart contracts that the Knowledger network will offer and will make available for whoever be interested to integrate with.

`Note: Project is on the way but we would like to bold some strategic points about what will come.`

# Core transactions

Some key transactions were designed and thought to be part of the smart contracts, through some transactions we expect to allow the different users participate wearing their hat.

**allowRole** - This is an abstraction of different transactions but all the roles will have its own transaction and a Knowledger user will be able to put any kind of hat, which are: Publisher (The creator of the contents), Reviewer (The person who do content's assessments) and the buyer (Anyone who wants to access some content and purchase)

**proposeContent** - To allow the user actor Publisher, the smart contracts will be prepared to provides a function to makes possible publishers mint their contents and have them as NFTs. The NFT will be generated with the content stored in the Filecoin, using the IPFS protocol, as one of the key parameters of the NFT. They also will put their prices and desirable crypto to allow buyers make their purchases using the defined crypto.

**approveContent / denyContent** - These are transactions that will be triggered from the Reviewer hat, where after some assessment they will be able to approve or deny some publisher content according to their assessments. This transactions is pretty interesting because the reviewers are stored in a pool and they are selected randomlly whenever a content is proposed by a publisher.

**buyContent** - Here is where the magic happens, when buyers purchase the contents that they would have interest they will be able to access the content and also have educative fun hours. Here the financial transactions will occur, sellers and reviewers will enjoy their profits forever, whenever a transaction has been completed.

**getContents** - All the roles can access their own transactions according to their hat and retrieve the contents they would propose/approve/deny/buy.

**getContent** - Retrieves information from a specific content

`Note: All the transactions will be controlled by some authorization depending of a specific role. For instance, you have a wallet and you can be all the roles at the same time, but when you're wearing the hat of a specific role you'll be only granted to do a transaction or retrieve some content depending of your specific role.`

# To infinity and Beyond

Tired to earn money but you think you can monetize or pontentialize your profit margin, don't worry, we plan to have governance transactions where you can monetize your NFT and sell its authorship for whoever have quite interesting to buy your product. You will be able to choose if you'd want to sell 100% of authorship or even less and continue have some lucrative in the further purchases, by this way you can create products concepts and levarage your carreer.

And for the last but not least

That's just the beggining of the journey, more is coming =)
